  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;"><strong>Hi Group Leaders,</strong></p>

  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">Thank you for taking the next steps in launching your official OR group! While many of us have different approaches to achieving progressive change, Bernie reminded us over and over that it's when we come together and get organized that we can make change happen. The coming years will be, in our opinion, the most important in recent political history - it's on us to 'right the course' of history, and that means getting local! We're excited to have you on board, and to empower your group with new members, resources, training, and programs that your group can plug into. </p>

  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;"><strong>YOUR GROUP ID NUMBER IS ID{{group_id}}</strong><br>Please keep this Group ID handy as you'll need it from time to time.</p>

  <h2>Here are the next steps in how to get your group online and official:</h2>

  <h3>1. Watch the MOU video and take the quiz</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">To learn more about the document and complete the onboarding process, the organizing team has created a video for you to watch at your convenience.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">Once you watch the video and answer a few questions to demonstrate that you understand the Memorandum of Understanding, the link to your group's MOU will be sent directly to your email inbox from the Organizing Dept. within 24 hours.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;"><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ourrevolution.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdpU2JmDHwl1ikYJqByX-Md-zJNG-HCPvbx3fk-0IvtxO9R6A/viewform" target="_blank">Take the next steps to getting your group on the map by watching the onboarding video and taking the quiz! </a></strong></p>

  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">You can view a sample MOU here: <a href="http://ourrev.us/premou" target="_blank">ourrev.us/premou</a></p>

  <h3>2. Sign your MOU</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">Once you pass the Memorandum of Understanding quiz with a score of an 80 or higher, you will receive an email from the Organizing Department with a link to access your group's MOU. If you have already attended a call, please search your inbox to see if you received an email from Organizing Dept. via Docusign. If you cannot locate your docusign after searching your inbox, please email <a href="mailto:juliana@ourrevolution.com" target="_blank">juliana@ourrevolution.com</a>.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;"><strong>Please be sure to fill out line one with your group name, line three with the first and last name of your group representative, and your signature at the bottom.</strong></p>

  <h3>3. You're official!</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">Once you receive a countersigned MOU in your inbox, your group is official. We will be reaching out to all affiliates in the coming days with the link to their group's landing page!  <strong><a href="https://ourrevolution.com/groups">Check out the local group map here</a>.</strong></p>

  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">If you have any questions, comments, concerns - or if you signed your MOU prior to today and did not receive your countersigned MOU - feel free to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:juliana@ourrevolution.com">juliana@ourrevolution.com</a>. </p>

  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">We're proud to be working with you to bring the political revolution to your community,</p>
