Hi Group Leaders,

Thank you for taking the next steps in launching your official OR group! While many of us have different approaches to achieving progressive change, Bernie reminded us over and over that it's when we come together and get organized that we can make change happen. The coming years will be, in our opinion, the most important in recent political history - it's on us to 'right the course' of history, and that means getting local! We're excited to have you on board, and to empower your group with new members, resources, training, and programs that your group can plug into. This email will outline next steps in the process to getting your group online and official.


** 1. Attend an MOU call
------------------------------------------------------------

We want everyone to attend an MOU call. The MOU outlines the relationship between local Our Revolution groups and the national organization. When registering for the call, please be sure to include the group ID number. Only attendees that include their group ID will receive a copy of the MOU.
