Hi {{group_name}},

Thank you for nominating {{candidate_name}} for a national
endorsement.

If this nomination for endorsement is for an election
*before* April 1st, 2019, we will work on getting back to
you soon.

If this nomination for endorsement is for an election
*after* April 1st, 2019, your group needs to attend an
in-service training on either Thursday, February 21st or
Saturday, March 2nd. *Attendance is mandatory for nominating a candidate for a
national endorsement.*

Your group can RSVP for the February in-service here

or the March in-service here
( https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/4798660565981995788 ).
For more on in-service trainings and for what to do should both in-service
training dates conflict with your schedule, email organizing@ourrevolution.com.

We wish you and your candidate the best and will continue to
fight the political revolution with you.


Solidarity,
THE OUR REVOLUTION TEAM
