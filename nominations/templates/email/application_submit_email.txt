Hey Our Revolution Friend!

We're excited to review your candidate nomination. While we cannot endorse everyone, we deeply appreciate all the care our groups take in sending us endorsed candidates.

Let me talk about the next steps from here. In all, this process takes several weeks.

Your candidate's application is now submitted in our system.

- This nomination will be sent to our researchers to look for additional information we factor in any endorsement
- Once that is complete, the political team staff will review it and add any new information.
- We may contact you during this process, but not hearing from us is totally normal, too.
- Once the research is complete, it will be presented to the Political Committee, which is a subset of Our Revolution's national board. They will have a final vote on whether we endorse or not. Staff do not have a vote on this.
- If an endorsement is made or not, we'll be in touch no matter what. We email at least the person who submitted the nomination and the candidate's staff.
- Even if endorsed, the nomination is not public until our communications department puts out a press release and graphic. This can take a few more weeks depending on our workload.

If the Political Committee votes to endorse the candidate, which we do not promise, please expect four to six weeks for a public endorsement to occur from the time your candidate submission is complete. Sometimes, unfortunately, it can be more.

Solidarity,
The Our Revolution Team
