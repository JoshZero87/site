DEAR OUR REVOLUTION MEMBER,

We're excited to review your candidate nomination. We deeply appreciate the time, energy, and care you put into researching and nominating candidates.

Let's review the next steps from here.

As you know, the progressive movement is highly energized, and this is something we all should be proud of. As a result, we receive dozens of nominations each month, therefore, this process takes several weeks. Lastly, as I'm sure you can understand, we cannot endorse every nominated candidate.

Your candidate's application is now submitted in our system.

 	* This nomination will be sent to our researchers to look for additional information we factor in any endorsement. 
 	* Once that is complete, the political team staff will review it and add any new information. 
 	* We may contact you during this process, but not hearing from us is totally normal, too. 
 	* Once the research is finished, it will be presented to the Political Committee, which is a subset of Our Revolution's Board of Directors. They will have a final vote on whether we endorse or not. Staff do not have a vote on this. 
 	* Once the decision is final, we'll be in touch to let you know if your candidate will receive a national endorsement or not. We email at least the person who submitted the nomination and the candidate's staff. 
 	* Please note - even if endorsed, the nomination is not public until our communications department puts out a press release and graphic. This can take a few more weeks depending on our workload.

If the Political Committee votes to endorse the candidate, which we do not promise, please expect four to six weeks for a public endorsement to occur from the time your candidate submission is complete. Sometimes, unfortunately, it can take longer. We greatly appreciate your patience throughout this rigorous and very important process.

Solidarity,
THE OUR REVOLUTION TEAM
