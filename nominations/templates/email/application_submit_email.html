    <strong>Hey Our Revolution Friend!</strong>
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
    We're excited to review your candidate nomination. While we cannot endorse
    everyone, we deeply appreciate all the care our groups take in sending us
    endorsed candidates.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
    Let me talk about the next steps from here. In all, this process takes
    several weeks.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
    Your candidate's application is now submitted in our system.
  </p>

  <ul style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">

    <li>
      This nomination will be sent to our researchers to look for additional
      information we factor in any endorsement
    </li>

    <li>
      Once that is complete, the political team staff will review it and add
      any new information.
    </li>

    <li>
      We may contact you during this process, but not hearing from us is
      totally normal, too.
    </li>

    <li>
      Once the research is complete, it will be presented to the Political
      Committee, which is a subset of Our Revolution's national board. They
      will have a final vote on whether we endorse or not. Staff do not have a
      vote on this.
    </li>

    <li>
      If an endorsement is made or not, we'll be in touch no matter what. We
      email at least the person who submitted the nomination and the
      candidate's staff.
    </li>

    <li>
      Even if endorsed, the nomination is not public until our communications
      department puts out a press release and graphic. This can take a few more
      weeks depending on our workload.
    </li>

  </ul>

  <p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: Arial; line-height:140%;">
    If the Political Committee votes to endorse the candidate, which we do not
    promise, please expect four to six weeks for a public endorsement to occur
    from the time your candidate submission is complete. Sometimes,
    unfortunately, it can be more.
  </p>

    Solidarity,<br />
    <strong>The Our Revolution Team</strong>
