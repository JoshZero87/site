      <h2>Our Nomination Process</h2>
      
      <p>Our Revolution seeks to empower the next generation of progressive leaders by inspiring and supporting progressive candidates to run for offices across the entire spectrum of government. From school boards to congressional seats, a new generation of political leaders, dedicated to transforming America’s corrupt campaign finance system and rigged economy, will be elected into office.</p>

      <p>In order to transform our country, we need everyone - progressive activists, women of color, immigrants, Native Americans, religious minorities, working class americans, and members of marginalized communities - to be elected into office at all levels.</p>

      <p>We value the power of local grassroots organizing and because of that, only candidates that have been nominated by local Our Revolution groups, or strategically identified by OR staff and supported by the local group, will be considered for an Our Revolution national endorsement.</p>
